 * You should return true whenever you think it would be a good time to ask for a card.
 * ALWAYS make AI methods modular so you can change parts as much as you wish.
 * AI can be done in different ways (Finite State Machines) or rules. Look up card counting
 * for a good blackjack AI idea.
 *
 * Parameters: None
 * Returns: ????? (up to you) a boolean whenever it wishes to draw a card
