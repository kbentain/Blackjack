 * Parameters: None
 * Returns:
 *      true if the answer was 'y' or 'Y'
 *      false otherwise
 *
 * Teaching moment:
 * There are multiple ways to handle this situation of taking input from a user.
 * We can have a few correct responses and a default answer "That's not a valid answer"
 * or we can use what is called a fail-safe default. That is to say if the answer is neither
 * 'y' or 'Y' we assume the answer is actually "No". Neither approach is really wrong.
 *
 * On the other hand, the one wrong answer would be to allow access or grant the request
 * for a "garbage" value. That is to say, we should not return true for the value 'x'.
 * This is usually seen as a security flaw. Get in the habit of only approving "positive"
 * matches and rejecting anything which does not match.
